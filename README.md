# EcoPlanner

### Authors: Vanessa Lu, Ershey Waqar, and Raima Hoque

EcoPlanner is my team's ECE297 Graphical Information Systems (GIS) Software Design Project, named so due to our focus on creating a user-friendly platform for environmentally conscious commuters. Developed with C++ and Git, our navigational GIS is optimized with A* algorithm routing built off of OpenStreetMap (OSM) Database APIs, with intuitive, universal GUI rendered through the GTK and EZGL graphics libraries.

## Overview:

## Path Finding Algorithm:
We implemented the A* Algorithm to find the most optimal path between 2 intersections, which can be selected with either the mouse or the search bars.

The route is then drawn on the map and a path directions window will open and stay on top of the map:

The above shows a route when selected through the search bars.
